                        <p>Santa María de Vilanova de la Barca is a 13th century Gothic church that was partially destroyed in 1936 by bombings during the Civil War. Since then the building had remained in a state of general ruin and only preserved the eastern head, some fragments of the naves and the western façade. The objective of the intervention was the restoration of the remains of the church and its recovery as a multipurpose room. The project establishes a complementary dialogue between the old and new parts, between past and present.</p>
                        <p>The original church has a type of basilica plan with two naves, a presbytery and side chapels. It is 22 meters long and 7 meters wide and the interior rises up to 10 meters. In the eastern part, imposing lateral buttresses are preserved, possibly of Romanesque origin, and in the head a late-Gothic ribbed vault from the 17th century. The church was built with ashlar from the area, very well edged and placed with joints, very damaged by the climate of the area and the erosion of time. Recently, the church was seriously affected by the construction of a semi-detached house on the site of the old moat.</p>
